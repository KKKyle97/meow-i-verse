# meow-i-verse

Meowiverse is a small social media ripoff by our team that tries to learn Vue.js by mimicking Instagram. 

## What to expect

As we are busy and having a day time job, this project will only be treated as a side-project and have the lowest priority of all, hence the sluggish progress is to be anticipated.

## Goals

The following goals are the most imminent of all:

- Learn by code
- Use internally for communication

## Development approach

We are practising [Trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) in this project. All PRs are kept small and modular. Branching off of a branch is not encouraged. PR reviews must be fast and avoid over-extending for better development experience.

## Local development

Prerequisite: 
- Node.js ^14

After that, `npm install`, `npm run serve` and all the gist of it.

## Todos (Major)

- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Security
